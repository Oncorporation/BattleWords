# Battlewords: History

## Foundation
- Invented in the early 1980s as "Word Battle," a paper-and-pencil grid game inspired by Battleship.
- Used in reading classes for international students at San Diego State University.
- In 1992, developed for submission to game agents; accepted by Technical Game Services (TGS).

## Rename & Presentation
- Renamed "Battlewords" in 1993.
- Presented to Milton-Bradley at the New York trade show, but only as a videotaped paper prototype.
- MB declined due to another European word game in development.

## Sabotage & Similar Games
- Turkish students reported a similar game, "The Admiral Sank," in Turkey.
- Suspicions arose that students adapted and sold the idea, which became "Battle Words" (two words) in Europe, licensed to Hasbro International.
- MB ultimately rejected the original Battlewords after seeing the European version.

## Reboot & Digital Version
- The European "Battle Words" faded into obscurity.
- The original creator retained prototypes and correspondence.
- Later collaborated with a Turkish programmer to create a Flash version of Battlewords for the website.
- Plans to further develop the game.
